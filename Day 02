In JavaScript, "documents" and "window" objects are both crucial components of the web browser environment, but they serve different purposes:

Document Object:
The document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.
It provides methods and properties to access and manipulate the content of the document, such as its elements (like <div>, <p>, <img>, etc.), text, attributes, and more.
You can access elements within the document using methods like getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), querySelector(), etc.
The document object is the entry point to interact with the structure and content of the web page.
Window Object:
The window object represents the browser window or tab that contains the document.
It is the global object in client-side JavaScript and serves as the JavaScript interface to the browser window.
It provides methods and properties for controlling the browser window itself, such as navigation (window.location), resizing (window.resizeTo()), opening new windows (window.open()), and more.
Additionally, it provides access to other objects like the document object (window.document) and global functions and objects (window.setTimeout(), window.console, etc.).
In summary, the document object represents the content of the web page, while the window object represents the browser window or tab and provides control over various browser-related functionalities.
